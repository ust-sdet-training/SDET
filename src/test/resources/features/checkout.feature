As a shopper , I want  to search the catalog , add a product to my cart,
and complete checkout, so that i can buy what i came for.


    Background:

    Scenario: Buy a single product end to end
        When I search for "headphones"
        And I add the first result to the cart
        Then the cart badge shows 1
        When I open the cart
        Then the cart has 1 line item
        When I place the order
        Then the order is confirmed

    Scenario Outline: Buy a "<product>" end to end
        When I search for "<product>"
        And I add the first result to the cart
        Then the cart badge shows <count>
        When I open the cart
        Then the cart has <count> line items
        When I place the order
        Then the order is confirmed

        Examples:
